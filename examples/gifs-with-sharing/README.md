# Gifs
> Reusable components with a shared state

[Demo](http://clarus.github.io/redux-ship/examples/gifs/)

The `random-gif` component downloads random gifs from [Giphy](http://giphy.com/). The `counter` component displays the number of times a gif was downloaded. The `counter` is shared by all the `random-gif` instances.

Start with:
```
npm install
npm start
```

Run the tests with:
```
npm test
```

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
